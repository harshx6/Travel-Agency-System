#Travel Agency

A travel agency application implemented in Java swing.

Requirements:

-Java 8

-Netbeans, or any other IDE

-sqlite, to store local data in transferrable files

Note: Sqlite has a pretty good Firefox manager add-on, but it's not compatible as of Firefox Quantum. 
Sqlite can be managed quite easily from the command shell, and has the advantage over localhost in that it actually stores its data in files; you can transfer your data from machine to machine if needed.
